# WhoAreMyTeammates?

<h1>Intro</h1>
A plugin for SCP: SL that shows the specified Team a list of their teammates on spawn.
Sends a broadcast out to the players on the team containing a list of their fellow players. For SCPs it will show a list of players with their SCP number in parenthesis. In addition there is the option for players to be notified on class change who is in their team.

<h1>Requirements</h1>

This plugin requires [EXILED]([https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED/releases](https://github.com/ExMod-Team/EXILED/releases) "Exiled Releases") `9.8.1`

* **is_enabled:** Defines if the plugin will be enabled or not. Only enter `true` or `false`.
